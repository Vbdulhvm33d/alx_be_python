#variable definition
number1 = 10
number2 = 5
#performing basic arithmetic operations
sum_of = number1 + number2
difference_of = number1 - number2
product_of = number1 * number2
#output
print("addition of", number1, "and", number2, "is", sum_of)
print("subtraction of", number1, "and", number2, "is", difference_of)
print("multiplication of", number1, "and", number2, "is", product_of)
